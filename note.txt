1. To begin the project, create an isolated environment within your project 
folder to prevent conflicts and ensure a clean workspace. 
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  
pip install pandas pyarrow # install the necessary packages

2. To run the pipeline.py script after reopening the project, first 
activate the .venv that contains the packages to use. 
source .venv/bin/activate

3. Then, run the line below to pass 12 as an argument and execute the script
python ./pipeline/pipeline.py 12

4. All the above can also be achieved using uv
pip install uv # if not already installed
for any project you are working on, you can specify the particular python
version you want installed in the virtual environment
uv init --python 3.13 
To confirm the 2 versions of python installed in the Global env. and the
virtual env, run python -V (for Global env) and uv run python -V (for virtual env)
To install packages inside the venv, run:
uv add pandas pyarrow
uv run python ./pipeline/pipeline.py 12 # to run the script with the venv
